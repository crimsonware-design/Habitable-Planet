        <p>How could we Colonize it: Many people/companies are already talking about colonizing mars; it would be highly likely to be colonized since it used to be like earth so there is lots of water under the surface that we can use to help build the bases and make them sustainable, Although it would be hard to contact and get here because even a radio signal takes 20 minutes to get to mars. With frequent storms we would need extraordinarily strong bases to survive and build habitats here. </p>
