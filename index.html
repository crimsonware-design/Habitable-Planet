       <h1>How did i get here?</h1>
       <p> I was thinking of wars and what engineering happened during wars<br>but then I started to wonder about the aftermath of the wars<br> and what we would do if we went into some type of apocalypse<br> where we could not live on earth anymore and had to go to another planet.</p>
